# üíæ Installation on Ubuntu/Debian

Install `python3`, `pip` and `venv`  via:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-venv
```

Clone and install the repo in a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv mann-pytorch-env
source mann-pytorch-env/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/ami-iit/mann-pytorch.git
cd mann-pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

# üöÄ Usage

### Training

You can execute a sample training script by:

```bash
cd mann-pytorch/scripts
python3 training.py
```

The training data will be periodically stored in a dedicated `mann-pytorch/models/storage_<training_start_time>` folder. You can also monitor the training progress by:

```bash
cd mann-pytorch/models/storage_<training_start_time>
python3 -m tensorboard.main --logdir=logs
```

### Testing

You can execute a sample testing script by:

```bash
cd mann-pytorch/scripts
python3 testing.py
```

The average loss of the learned model on the testing dataset will be printed. Moreover, you will be able to inspect the learned model performances by comparing the ground truth and the predicted output on each instance of the testing dataset.
